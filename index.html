        <p class="content">Now you may be wondering why I even made this website. To me, this website is a perfect opportunity to solidify skills and knowledge that I learn from my coding boot-camp.
            Why otters though? As silly as it may seem, otters have a deeper meaning to me as they are Sophie's favorite animal. In other words, this website is dedicated to no other than
            Sophie Herrera. Don't worry, I'll be adding more to this website as time goes on and I learn even more skills concerning JS, and more.
